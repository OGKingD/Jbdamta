            <h5 class="top-title mb-3">Efficiency Fuel Filtration</h5>
            <p> Fuel Contamination is one risk you should not have to worry about. Tank Cleaning and Easy Fuel Filtration removes the problem. We offer quick and efficient cleaning of even your most grueling and hard-to-clean tanks, promising high quality and low price. We remove all forms of contamination and sludge from your stored fuel, providing it clean, dry and ready to power your equipment dependably. </p>
            <p>Modern engines demand clean fuel and onboard filtration is not enough. If contaminated fuel is used, onboard filtartion becomes overpowered and injectors damaged. This means more downtime and maintenance. We strongly recommend fuel filtration to be centered at point of delivery. We offer Ultra High Efficieny Filters that ensures the highest filtration efficiency and reduces the risk of contamination in storage tanks.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to take your preventive maintenance practices to the next level, to protect your fuel storage tanks, your fuel and your expensive engines. </p>

            <h5 class="top-title mb-3">Fuel Contamination Testing</h5>
            <p>JB DAM TA provide tank calibration services for horizontal and vertical tanks; UST (Underground Storage Tank) and AST (Aboveground Storage Tank). Methods used are  applicable to pressurized tanks, knuckle-dish-end tanks, flat end tanks, elliptical and  spherical head tanks. Tanks can either be calibrated physically, i.e. By physical measurement of the tank shell or by volumetric method, i.e. adding or withdrawing   measured volumes of liquid. </p>
  
            <p>Ensuring the quality of fuel at point of delivery is a fundamental part of preventive maintenance practices. We offer fuel contamination testing equipment that provides accurate results for many years. Water in fuel testing equipment tests the percentage of water in fuel within the ranges 0.02 - 1.0 %, 0 - 10 %, 0 - 20 % and 1 - 10,000ppm. Diesel density testing equipment is designed to measure the density of fuel or lubrication oil either at 50oC or 700​C.</p>
